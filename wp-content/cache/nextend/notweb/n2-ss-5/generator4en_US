In his introduction of Jabs, who in 2013\u00a0<span class=\"s1\">made a $10 million contribution<\/span>\u00a0to expand entrepreneurship education, research, programmatic reach and caliber within the CU Denver Business School, Parthasarathy said \u201cColorado\u2019s greatest entrepreneur\u201d came from modest means in a small town in Montana.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Great philanthropist\u2019<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cEverything Jake\u2019s made he\u2019s made by hard work, dedication, a little bit of luck and by making smart, passionate decisions,\u201d Parthasarathy said. \u201cHe\u2019s also a great philanthropist.\u201d<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Jabs said his first love was music. In fact, before his talk, he displayed his guitar-playing chops with Diamondback Bluegrass, a CU Denver quintet. The group is made up of students Olivia Shaw (fiddle), Scott Sherman (mandolin), Alex Goldberg (upright bass), Matt Telsey (keyboard) and Gil Clark (guitar).<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Jabs owned a trio of music stores in Montana before discovering that furniture offered a much brighter retail future than musical instruments.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">He launched AFW in Denver in 1975 and now has stores across Colorado and two in Arizona. Jabs espouses living within your means, carrying little if any debt, working hard and following your passion.

It makes you work harder and fine-tune your company.<\/li>\r\n\t<li class=\"li1\">Become social media\/digital savvy. He explained that AFW launched its store in Gilbert, Ariz., three years ago using only social media to publicize the grand opening. \u201cIn the first month, we did $2 million in sales using only social media as advertising,\u201d he said. \u201cThat store now does $100 million a year.\u201d<\/li>\r\n\t<li class=\"li1\">Create a great website. More and more commerce is taking place online and it\u2019s imperative for entrepreneurs to service customers through an informative and user-friendly website.<\/li>\r\n\t<li class=\"li1\">Fill a need in the market with your business and provide value to society.<\/li>\r\n\t<li class=\"li1\">Provide great value and service to your customers.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>\u2018Have a passion\u2019<\/b><\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">He emphasized the importance of being honest, being efficient (AFW owns a huge fleet of trucks and all of its showrooms, and its furniture buyers negotiate directly with factories worldwide \u2013 all greatly reducing costs) and giving back to your community. Last year, AFW donated nearly $3.5 million to various charities, organizations and schools across Colorado and Arizona. Jabs also donates his time to philanthropic causes. He mentors students at CU Denver and is a major contributor to the Business School at his alma mater, Montana State University.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">He estimates that he still works 60 to 70 hours a week, six days a week. He is regularly seen in the classrooms and his office in the Jake Jabs Center for Entrepreneurship in the Business School. He doesn\u2019t view any of it as work, though, because he loves what he\u2019s doing.<\/p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">\u201cIf you have a passion for what you do, you will work the extra hours,\u201d Jabs said. \u201cYou will do research; you will read up on things.
